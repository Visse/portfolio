# Introduction

This is part of a bigger project but I think its worth showing by its self. Its a collection of different algorithms for constructing [implicit surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface).
First a short introduction to each algorithm.

**Marching Cubes (MC)** This is probably the most famous of these algorithms. Its was developed in 1987 for reconstruction 3d surfaces. It works on a uniform grid with each corner being assigned a value. It when iterates each cell and check the edges. Based on the result of the check it looks up the resulting mesh in a case table. The algorithm is very simple to implement and fast - the hardest part is to create the case table. It had several downfalls, it couldn't represent sharp edges and it generated a mesh with far from perfect triangulation. It is still used today for its simplicity and speed.

**Dual Contouring (DC)** was a mayor improvement over *MC*, it could not only handle sharp corners, it also (in most cases) generated a better surface representation using fewer triangles. It could do so by being able to place vertexes inside of cells, instead of on the edges between them like *MC* did. However it have a mayor downside in that the surface its generates is not guaranteed to be manifold. To solve this 2 new algorithms was presented in 2004, both with the name Dual Marching Cubes.

**Dual Contouring Marching Cubes (DCMC)** was named *Dual Marching Cubes* in the paper that presented it, but to make it easier to differentiate it from the other similary named algorithm I call it *DCMC*. My reason is how the algorithm works. It uses a similar method as *DC* to place it vertexes, but it runs a *MC* variant to connect the vertexes together, (therefor I gave it the name *DCMC*).

**Adoptive Dual Contouring**

**Dual Marching Cubes (DMC)** was the other algorithm presented, it extends *DC* by allowing multiple vertexes in each cell. More specifically it places a vertexes for each patch generated by the original *MC*. The surface that this algorithm generates is the topology dual to the surface generated by *MC*. Since the original *MC* generated manifold meshes so does *DMC*.

**Manifold Dual Contouring (MDC)** extends *DMC* to generate adoptive surface. This adoptive surface have several nice properties such as being manifold. The method proposed in the paper can also simplify surfaces close together without loosing the surface topology (connecting the surfaces together).

I don't know much of this method, other than that many of the other algorithms refer to it. Because of that I would like to research more about it and try to implement it someday.

## Terms

**Iso Surface** An iso surface is defined by the function $$f(p) = 0$$. For example the function $$f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2- r^2$$ represents a sphere with the radius $$r$$.

**Uniform Grid** This is a grid there each *cell* is the same size.

**Octree** This a spatial tree data structure there each cell has 8 children.
